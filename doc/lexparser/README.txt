Stanford Lexicalized Parser v3.6.0 - 2015-12-09
-----------------------------------------------

Original core parser code by Dan Klein.  Support code, additional
modules, languages, features, internationalization, compaction, typed
dependencies, etc. by Christopher Manning, Roger Levy, Teg Grenager,
Galen Andrew, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Jenny Finkel, Spence Green,
Bill MacCartney, Anna Rafferty, Huihsin Tseng, Pi-Chuan Chang,
Wolfgang Maier, Richard Eckart, Richard Socher, John Bauer,
Sebastian Schuster, and Jon Gauthier.

This release was prepared by Jason Bolton.

This package contains 4 parsers: a high-accuracy unlexicalized PCFG; a
lexicalized dependency parser; a factored model, where the estimates
of dependencies and an unlexicalized PCFG are jointly optimized to
give a lexicalized PCFG treebank parser; and an RNN parser, where
recursive neural networks trained with semantic word vectors are used
to score parse trees.  Also included are grammars for various
languages for use with these parsers.

For more information about the parser API, point a web browser at the
included javadoc directory (use the browser's Open File command to open
the index.html file inside the javadoc folder).  Start by looking at the
Package page for the edu.stanford.nlp.parser.lexparser package, and then
look at the page for the LexicalizedParser class documentation therein,
particularly documentation of the main method.

Secondly, you should also look at the Parser FAQ on the web:

    http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/parser-faq.shtml

This software requires Java 8 (JDK 1.8.0+).  (You must have installed it
separately. Check that the command "java -version" works and gives 1.8+.)


QUICKSTART

UNIX COMMAND-LINE USAGE

On a Unix system you should be able to parse the English test file with the
following command:	

    ./lexparser.sh data/testsent.txt

This uses the PCFG parser, which is quick to load and run, and quite accurate.

[Notes: it takes a few seconds to load the parser data before parsing
begins; continued parsing is quicker. To use the lexicalized parser, replace
englishPCFG.ser.gz with englishFactored.ser.gz in the lexparser.sh script
and use the flag -mx600m to give more memory to java.]

WINDOWS GUI USAGE

On a Windows system, assuming that java is on your PATH, you should be able
to run a parsing GUI by double-clicking on the lexparser-gui.bat icon,
or giving the command lexparser-gui in this directory from a command prompt.

Click Load File, Browse, and navigate to and select testsent.txt in
the top directory of the parser distribution.  Click Load Parser,
Browse, and select the models jar, also in the top directory of the
parser distribution.  From the models jar, select englishPCFG.ser.gz.
Click Parse to parse the first sentence.

OTHER USE CASES

The GUI is also available under Unix:

    lexparser-gui.sh

Under Mac OS X, you can double-click on lexparser-gui.command to invoke the
GUI.  The command-line version works on all platforms.	Use lexparser.bat
to run it under Windows.  The GUI is only for exploring the parser. It does
not allow you to save output.  You need to use the command-line program or
programmatic API to do serious work with the parser.

ADDITIONAL GRAMMARS

The parser is supplied with several trained grammars. There are English
grammars based on the standard LDC Penn Treebank WSJ training sections 2-21
(wsj*), and ones based on an augmented data set, better for questions,
commands, and recent English and biomedical text (english*).

All grammars are located in the included models jar. (If you'd like to have
grammar files like in older versions of the parser, you can get them by
extracting them from the jar file with the 'jar -xf' command.)

MULTILINGUAL PARSING
In addition to the English grammars, the parser comes with trained grammars
for Arabic, Chinese, French, and German. To parse with these grammars, run

    lexparser-lang.sh

with no arguments to see usage instructions. You can change language-specific
settings passed to the parser by modifying lexparser_lang.def.

You can also train and evaluate new grammars using:

    lexparser-lang-train-test.sh

To see how we trained the grammars supplied in this distribution, see

    bin/makeSerialized.csh

You will not be able to run this script (since it uses Stanford-specific file
paths), but you should be able to see what we did.

Arabic
Trained on parts 1-3 of the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) using the
pre-processing described in (Green and Manning, 2010). The default input
encoding is UTF-8 Arabic script. You can convert text in Buckwalter encoding to UTF-8
with the package edu.stanford.nlp.international.arabic.Buckwalter which is included 
in stanford-parser.jar.

The parser *requires* segmentation and tokenization of raw text per the ATB standard
prior to parsing. You can generate this segmentation and tokenization with the Stanford 
Word Segmenter, which is available separately at:

  http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/segmenter.shtml

Chinese
There are Chinese grammars trained just on mainland material from
Xinhua and more mixed material from the LDC Chinese Treebank. The default
input encoding is GB18030.

French
Trained on the functionally annotated section of the French Treebank
(FTB) using the pre-processing described in (Green et al., 2011). For raw text input,
a tokenizer is enabled by default that produces FTB tokenization. To disable this
tokenizer, use the "-tokenized" option. To tokenize raw text separately, see
the usage information in edu.stanford.nlp.international.french.process.FrenchTokenizer.

German
Trained on the Negra corpus. Details are included in (Rafferty and
Manning, 2008).

TREEBANK PREPROCESSING

The pre-processed versions of the ATB described
in (Green and Manning, 2010) and the FTB described in (Green et al.,
2011) can be reproduced using the TreebankPreprocessor included in this
release. The configuration files are located in /conf. For example,
to create the ATB data, run:

    bin/run-tb-preproc -v conf/atb-latest.conf

Note that you'll need to update the conf file paths to your local treebank
distributions as the data is not distributed with the parser. You'll
also need to set the classpath in the cmd_line variable of run-tb-preproc.

The TreebankPreprocessor conf files support various options, which are
documented in

    edu.stanford.nlp.international.process.ConfigParser

EVALUATION METRICS

The Stanford parser comes with Java implementations of the following
evaluation metrics:

    Dependency Labeled Attachment

    Evalb         (Collins, 1997)
      -Includes per-category evaluation with the -c option

    Leaf Ancestor (Sampson and Babarczy, 2003)
      -Both micro- and macro-averaged score

    Tagging Accuracy

See the usage instructions and javadocs in the requisite classes located in
edu.stanford.nlp.parser.metrics.

UNIVERSAL DEPENDENCIES vs. STANFORD DEPENDENCIES

Since v3.5.2 the default dependency representation is the new Universal Dependencies
representation. Universal Dependencies were developed with the goal of being a
cross-linguistically valid representation. Note that some constructs such as prepositional
phrases are now analyzed differently and that the set of relations was updated. Please 
look at the Universal Dependencies documentation for more information:

      http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/

The parser also still supports the original Stanford Dependencies representation 
as described in the StanfordDependenciesManual.pdf. Use the flag

     -originalDependencies

to obtain original Stanford Dependencies.
