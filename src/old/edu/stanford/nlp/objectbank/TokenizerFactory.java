 * A TokenizerFactory is used to convert a java.io.Reader

 * in the java.io.Reader.  It's mainly a convenience, since you could cast
 * down anyway.
 *
 * <i>Note:</i> A TokenizerFactory should also provide a static method: <br><code>
 * public static TokenizerFactory&lt;? extends HasWord&gt; newTokenizerFactory();
 * </code><br>
 * This is expected by certain JavaNLP code which wants to produce a
 * TokenizerFactory by reflection.
