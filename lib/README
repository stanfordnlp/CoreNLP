README for $JAVANLP_HOME/core/lib

Written by Bill MacCartney <wcmac@cs.stanford.edu> 23 January 2006
Updated by Daniel Ramage 16 October 2006

This directory is intended to contain only *current and necessary*
.jar files used with JavaNLP-core.  

Our original model was that each jar file in lib should be without
its version number but include a corresponding source .zip/.jar file
with a full version number in the libsrc folder.  For example, if
there is a file  lib/ra.jar there should be a corresponding and
up-to-date libsrc/ra-0.1.8-src.zip. That had some good properties
but could also be a nuisance in the modern world, so it is also
fine and more common recently for people to have in lib a
lib/ra-0.1.8.jar corresponding to a libsrc/ra-0.1.8-src.{zip,jar}.

Outdated or redundant .jar files should NOT be kept here, but can
be stored instead in /u/nlp/java/liball.  Files in that directory
can have version numbers in the name.  Example: colt1.0.3.jar.

If you're adding a new .jar to the repository, please:
 - make sure the jar isn't already somewhere in the repository.
   If it is, try to converge on one version and promote placement to
   more if it is used in multiple projects
 - add the jar itself to the lib directory (with or without version number)
 - add its source zip with version number to the libsrc directory
 - check to make sure that the jar file doesn't have other libraries
   embedded within it (use jar -tf). if the .jar file has other libraries
   embedded which overlap with other javanlp libraries, please remove them.
   Normally we then give the jar a name ending in "x" to show we modified it.
 - update the Eclipse .classpath file to include the jar and a path
   to its source -- this is essential to keep things working for 
   Eclipse/IntelliJ users!
 - also update this file with information about the jar
 - If it will be needed by releases of CoreNLP, also add it to the *2* pom files.
 - If it will be needed by releases of CoreNLP, also document the
   licensing in LIBRARY-LICENSES.

Any .jar files which appear in this directory should be listed in
this file, with the following information:

ORIGINAL JAR NAME: original name of the .jar file when downloaded

VERSION: version number

RELEASE DATE: when the library was originally released.

SOURCE AVAILABLE: yes or no, if it is available it should be checked in
to the repository under libsrc

DESCRIPTION: a short description of the library's function and purpose.

URL: where to check for library information, documentation, and updates.

USED BY: what JavaNLP packages use this library. (This need not be exhaustive,
but should list a couple of key packages that use/need this library.)
This should make clear whether it is neede by CoreNLP distributions.

LAST UPDATE: when we last updated our copy from the source.

LAST UPDATE BY: who last updated it
