 * of numbered files in collections where each file has some name, part
 * of which is alphabetic and constant, and part of which is numeric.
 * The test is evaluated based on the rightmost natural number found in
 * the filename string.  (It only looks in the final filename, not in other
 * components of the path.)  Number ranges are inclusive.
