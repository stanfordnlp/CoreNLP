The parser TregexParser.jj is built with javacc.  If you change it, you need
to rebuild it with javacc:

   javacc TregexParser.jj

javacc can be found in /u/nlp/java/libsrc/javacc/bin/javacc


Rebuilding the Mac OS X version of the GUI:

Run Jar Bundler on the Mac.

For Main Class, click Choose and select the new jar.

Select "Use Macintosh Menu Bar"

Click "Choose Icon..." and select

      nlp-logo-6x6.icns

(which you of course remembered to download beforehand!)

Click Properties

Enter the version number in each of the three version fields.

Enter the main class name in Identifier

Put 400m in Heap Maximum size.

Click Create Application.

Create it as "Stanford Tregex" (really "Stanford Tregex.app" but the GUI
usually hides the extension).

Open a tool (which you've downloaded) like FreeDMG.

Drop Stanford Tregex on it.

Rename the .dmg what it produces to be the same as the distro name, but
ending in .dmg.

You're done!
