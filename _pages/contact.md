## Mailing lists

We have 3 mailing lists for Stanford CoreNLP, all of which are shared with other JavaNLP tools (with the exclusion of the parser). Each address is at `@lists.stanford.edu`:

1. `java-nlp-user` This is the best list to post to in order to send feature requests, make announcements, or for discussion among JavaNLP users. (Please ask support questions on [github](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP).)
You have to subscribe to be able to use this list. Join the list via [this webpage]() or by emailing `java-nlp-user-join@lists.stanford.edu`. (Leave the subject and message body empty.) You can also look at the [list archives](https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/java-nlp-user/).

2. `java-nlp-announce` This list will be used only to announce new versions of Stanford JavaNLP tools. So it will be very low volume (expect 2-4 messages a year). Join the list via [this webpage](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/java-nlp-announce) or by emailing `java-nlp-announce-join@lists.stanford.edu`. (Leave the subject and message body empty.)

3. `java-nlp-support` This list goes only to the software maintainers. It's a good address for licensing questions, etc. **For general use and support questions, you're better off using github or joining and using `java-nlp-user`**. You cannot join `java-nlp-support`, but you can mail questions to `java-nlp-support@lists.stanford.edu`.
