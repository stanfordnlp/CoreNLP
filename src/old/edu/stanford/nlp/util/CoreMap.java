/**
 * <p>
 * Base type for all annotatable core objects. Should usually be instantiated as
 * {@link ArrayCoreMap}. Many common key definitions live in
 * {@link edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations}, but others may be defined elsewhere. See
 * {@link edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations} for details.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that implementations of this interface must take care to implement
 * equality correctly: by default, two CoreMaps are .equal if they contain the
 * same keys and all corresponding values are .equal. Subclasses that wish to
 * change this behavior (such as {@link HashableCoreMap}) must make sure that
 * all other CoreMap implementations have a special case in their .equals to use
 * that equality definition when appropriate. Similarly, care must be taken when
 * defining hashcodes. The default hashcode is 37 * sum of all keys' hashcodes
 * plus the sum of all values' hashcodes. However, use of this class as HashMap
 * keys is discouraged because the hashcode can change over time. Consider using
 * a {@link HashableCoreMap}.
