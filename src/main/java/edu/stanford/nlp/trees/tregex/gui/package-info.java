/**
 * <p>
 * A package for the graphical interface for Tregex and TSurgeon.  The main
 * class to work with is TregexGUI, which launches the interface.  See
 * README-gui.txt for more information about running these classes, and in
 * general, classes from outside this package shouldn't link to anything
 * other than possibly ScrollableTreeJPanel (which provides an extension to
 * TreeJPanel that works within a ScrollPane).
