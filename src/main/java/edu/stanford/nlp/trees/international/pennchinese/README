Chinese-English Map Utilities v0.1 - 05 Jan 2005
----------------------------------------------

(c) Leland Stanford Junior University 2005.

Included are utilities for mapping Chinese characters to
their primary radicals, and mapping Chinese words to English.

The unicode mapping is taken from Unihan database of CJK characters,
based on Unicode standard:

The Chinese to English word map is taken from CEDict Chinese-English
Lexicon.  Future versions of this package will support multiple Lexicons.

The code was written by Galen Andrew.

QUICKSTART
-----------------------------------------------

These files are intended for programmatic use, but include simple main
methods.  The following command will lookup translations of Chinese
words in the given example input file. (Such a file needs to have
whitespace-separated words.)
 
java -cp chinese_map_utils.jar edu.stanford.nlp.trees.international.pennchinese.ChineseEnglishWordMap test.txt > test.out

This command will look up the radicals of the characters:

java -cp chinese_map_utils.jar edu.stanford.nlp.trees.international.pennchinese.RadicalMap -infile test.txt > test.out
