/**
 * Implements a variant on the HeadFinder found in Michael Collins' 1999
 * thesis. This starts with
 * Collins' head finder. As in {@code CollinsHeadFinder}, we've
 * added a head rule for NX.
 * <p>
 * Changes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The PRN rule used to just take the leftmost thing, we now have it
 * choose the leftmost lexical category (not the common punctuation etc.)
 * <li>Delete IN as a possible head of S, and add FRAG (low priority)
 * <li>Place NN before QP in ADJP head rules (more to do for ADJP!)
 * <li>Place PDT before RB and after CD in QP rules.  Also prefer CD to
 * DT or RB.  And DT to RB.
 * <li>Add DT, WDT as low priority choice for head of NP. Add PRP before PRN
 * Add RBR as low priority choice of head for NP.
 * <li>Prefer NP or NX as head of NX, and otherwise default to rightmost not
 * leftmost (NP-like headedness)
 * <li>VP: add JJ and NNP as low priority heads (many tagging errors)
 *   Place JJ above NP in priority, as it is to be preferred to NP object.
 * <li>PP: add PP as a possible head (rare conjunctions)
 * <li>Added rule for POSSP (can be introduced by parser)
 * <li>Added a sensible-ish rule for X.
 * <li>Added NML head rules, which are the same as for NP.
 * <li>NP head rule: NP and NML are treated almost identically (NP has precedence)
 * <li>NAC head rule: NML comes after NN/NNS but after NNP/NNPS
 * <li>PP head rule: JJ added
 * <li>Added JJP (appearing in David Vadas's annotation), which seems to play
 * the same role as ADJP.
 * </ol>
 * These rules are suitable for the Penn Treebank.
 * <p>
 * A case that you apparently just can't handle well in this framework is
 * (NP (NP ... NP)).  If this is a conjunction, apposition or similar, then
 * the leftmost NP is the head, but if the first is a measure phrase like
 * (NP $ 38) (NP a share) then the second should probably be the head.
