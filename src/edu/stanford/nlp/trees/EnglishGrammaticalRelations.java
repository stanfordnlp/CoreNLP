/**
 * {@code EnglishGrammaticalRelations} is a
 * set of {@link GrammaticalRelation} objects for the English language.
 * These relations are commonly called Stanford Dependencies (SD).
 *
 * Grammatical relations can either be shown in their basic form, where each
 * input token receives a relation, or "collapsed" which does certain normalizations
 * which group words or turns them into relations. See
 * {@link EnglishGrammaticalStructure}.  What is presented here mainly
 * shows the basic form, though there is some mixture. The "collapsed" grammatical
 * relations primarily differ as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Some multiword conjunctions and prepositions are treated as single
 * words, and then processed as below.</li>
 * <li>Prepositions do not appear as words but are turned into new "prep" or "prepc"
 * grammatical relations, one for each preposition.</li>
 * <li>Conjunctions do not appear as words but are turned into new "conj"
 * grammatical relations, one for each conjunction.</li>
 * <li>The possessive "'s" is deleted, leaving just the relation between the
 * possessor and possessum.</li>
 * <li>Agents of passive sentences are recognized and marked as agent and not as prep_by.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * This set of English grammatical relations is not intended to be
 * exhaustive or immutable.  It's just where we're at now.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * See {@link GrammaticalRelation} for details of fields and matching.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * If using LexicalizedParser, it should be run with the
 * {@code -retainTmpSubcategories} option and one of the
 * {@code -splitTMP} options (e.g., {@code -splitTMP 1}) in order to
 * get the temporal NP dependencies maximally right!
 * <p/>
 * <i>Implementation notes: </i> Don't change the set of GRs without discussing it
 * with people first.  If a change is needed, to add a new grammatical relation:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Governor nodes of the grammatical relations should be the lowest ones.</li>
 * <li> Check the semantic head rules in SemanticHeadFinder and
 * ModCollinsHeadFinder, both in the trees package. That's what will be used to
 * match here.</li>
 * <li> Create and define the GrammaticalRelation similarly to the others.</li>
 * <li> Add it to the {@code values} array at the end of the file.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The patterns in this code assume that an NP may be followed by either a
 * -ADV or -TMP functional tag but there are no other functional tags represented.
 * This corresponds to what we currently get from NPTmpRetainingTreeNormalizer or
 * DependencyTreeTransformer.
